# dConfess

This dApp is basically a confession platform  where you can confess anonymously ,you can make multiple confessions.
As Valentine week was approaching we thought of creating some platform where one can pour out one's inner feelings without
getting revealed his/her identity.This dapp uses salient feature of blockchain anonymity .

## Challenges we ran into
while making this dapp we came across many challenges like while integrating blockchain with dynamic front-end ,clubbing
blockchain responses with JSX.While transacting with metamask we came across rpc errors.One of the major challenge was configuration with
the generated abi.
